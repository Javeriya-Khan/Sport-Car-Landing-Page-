# Sport-Car-Landing-Page-
Interactive Sports Cars Landing Page UI** 🏁

I'm excited to share a recent project I built for my **Front-End Development Fellowship submission** — a fully responsive, animated, and interactive **Landing Page for Sports Cars**, developed using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project is a reflection of both my technical capabilities and creative thinking.

💡 **Project Goal:**
To design a modern landing page that demonstrates **user-focused design**, **smooth animation**, and **strong front-end coding fundamentals** — with no external libraries or frameworks, just raw logic and custom visuals.

🧩 **Key Features of the Landing Page:**

🔹 **Full-Screen Cinematic Background Video**
 – Creates an energetic and immersive visual experience.
 – Syncs beautifully with the overall sports car theme.

🔹 **Custom Car Image Carousel**
 – Users can switch between high-performance sports cars.
 – Smooth transition effects for professional user flow.

🔹 **Animated 3D-Like Moving Cube with Trailers**
 – This unique feature showcases car thumbnails on rotating cube sides.
 – Symbolizes speed, futuristic tech, and user engagement.
 – Controlled via JavaScript with precise transitions and class management.

🔹 **Fully Responsive Design**
 – Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
 – Media queries and fluid layouts used for scalability.

🔹 **Clean, Structured Code**
 – HTML5 used for semantic layout.
 – CSS3 for styling, transitions, hover effects, and animations.
 – Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event-driven behavior.

🧠 **What I Learned:**

✅ Handling dynamic UI logic using JavaScript
✅ Using animations effectively to tell a story
✅ Working with `position`, `z-index`, and `media queries` to manage layout challenges
✅ Syncing video backgrounds with content
✅ Enhancing visual appeal through custom-designed elements like the **animated cube**

📽️ **Check out the video demo** attached to see the full interaction in action — a blend of **performance, precision, and creativity**.

🌱 I'm actively seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and collaborate through this fellowship — and I look forward to working on more real-world, user-centered design projects.

💬 I'd love your feedback and suggestions!
Let’s connect and discuss ideas in **creative coding**, **front-end development**, or **student-led tech innovation**.
